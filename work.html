        <div class="cont"><P>Writing code, debugging and seeing things run smoothly is realy saatisfactory for me,
            because I have known myself to be a result oriented person. I love to write code, to solve problems, to distill my knowledge and skill into executable form and watch it operate outside of my head.
            I posess entry level skills in Python programming, Intermediate at web developing using HTML and CSS, and advanced level in Java programming
        </P></div>
        <div class="cont"><p>I am also passionate about listening to and making good music. Music is like a safe place for me. I can’t explain it but I feel really warm when I play a song or stuff.

            I don’t really aspire to be a musician BTW. I mean, if I do become one then, good for me! I just really want to play when I feel stressed, etc.
            
            Music is one of the few reasons why I’m still alive.
             
            I joined this field with the simple BandLab Mobile application
            and at the moment, I'm well acquainted with FL studio to make beats, song melodies and chord progressions.

        <div class="cont"><p>However, one other thing I'm passionate about is photography. Way back when I was about 10 I discovered my dads black and white photo processing kit. Of course I wanted to try it so read the instructions on how it worked, found out about negatives and bromide paper , how to make contact prints developed them and fix the image. I was fascinated , it was like magic to a kid back then. Been hooked ever since. </p></div>
