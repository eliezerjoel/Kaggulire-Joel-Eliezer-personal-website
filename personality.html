            <h2>Mind</h2>
            <p>I am a caring and intelligent person. I would do anything for my family and everything I do is basically looking out for their needs. I love children a lot and am always looking into everything that has to do with them.I love reading all the time. I also really like to cook! I’m always looking for new recipes to make or foods to try.</p>
            <h2>Energy</h2>
            <p>I’m a hard working person who doesn’t like to give up. I strive for what I want and keep my goals in mind 24/7. This allows me to see exactly what I want and plan on how I will get it.</p>
            <h2>Nature</h2>
            <p>My personality is kind of complex. I take a lot of time to get used to new people- before I feel comfortable with you, I’m very quiet and reserved. Once I get to know you, I’m a completely different person- I’m sarcastic, outspoken, and silly.</p>
            <h2>Tactics</h2>
            <p>I would say that I am independent and determined. I am highly introverted but most people do not know that until they get to know me because I put on a really good “extrovert” front. I am extremely sensitive and an over thinker. I am Type A to a point.
                <h2>Identity</h2>
                <p>I am fairly easy going. I am willing to help anyone at any time. I do not like to be taken advantage of.</p>
